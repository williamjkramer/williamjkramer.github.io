It is essential if your children become incapacitated, are traveling, or for any other reasons they are unable to handle their financial affairs.<\/li><li><strong>FERPA Release<\/strong>: The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) requires that students over the age of 18 sign a release to give their parents access to their grades, transcripts, and other school information.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the consequences of not having these documents?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do not have these documents in place once your children turn 18, you may be unable to assist them in making financial and healthcare decisions.&nbsp; What if your child gets in a car accident or becomes terminally ill?&nbsp; Without a healthcare directive, or HIPPA authorization, you may not have access to their current medical condition or be able to make decisions regarding their medical care.&nbsp; Without a durable power of attorney or FERPA release, you may not be able to access your child\u2019s grades at school, complete their financial aid application, look up the cost of their tuition, or access their bank account to pay bills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being prepared and obtaining the appropriate legal documents for your over-18 children prevents unnecessary stress and frustration.&nbsp;
