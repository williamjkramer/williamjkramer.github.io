An old joke says that you should choose an enemy to perform the task because it is such a thankless job, even though the executor may take a percentage of the estate\u2019s assets as a fee. The following issues should be considered when choosing an executor for one&#8217;s estate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Competency<\/strong>: The executor of an estate will be going through financial and legal documents and transferring documents from the testator to the beneficiaries. If there are legal proceedings, the executor must make all necessary court appearances. There is no requirement that a testator have any financial or legal training, but familiarity with these areas does avoid the intimidation felt by lay people, and potentially saves money on professional fees.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Trustworthiness<\/strong>: The signature of an executor is equivalent to that of the testator of an estate. The executor has full control over all of an estate\u2019s assets. He or she will be required to go through all of the papers of the deceased to confirm what assets are available to be distributed. The temptation to transfer assets into the executor&#8217;s own name always exists, particularly when there is a large estate. It is important to choose a person with integrity who will resist this temptation. It makes sense to utilize an individual who is an heir to fill the role to alleviate this concern.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Availability<\/strong>: The work of collecting rents, maintaining property, and paying debts can take more than a few hours a week. Selecting an executor with significant obligations to work or family may cause problems if he or she does not have the time available to devote to the task. If an executor must travel great distances to address issues that arise, there will be more of a time commitment necessary, not to mention greater expenses for the estate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Family dynamics<\/strong>: Selection of the wrong person to act as executor can create resentment and hostility among an estate\u2019s heirs. A testator should be aware of how family members interact with one another and avoid picking someone who may provoke conflict. Even the perception of impropriety can lead to a lawsuit, which will serve to take money out of the estate\u2019s coffers and delay the legitimate distribution of the estate.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The role of an executor is to effectuate a deceased person\u2019s wishes as declared in a will after he or she has passed on.
