In some cases, after the passing of the trustmaker, loved ones or beneficiaries may want to remove the designated trustee.<\/p>\n<p>The process to remove a trustee largely depends on two factors: 1) language contained with the trust and 2) state law. When determining your options, there are a number of issues and key considerations to keep in mind.<\/p>\n<p>First, it is possible that the trust language grants you the specific right to remove the named trustee. If it does, it likely will also outline how you must do so and whether you must provide a reason you want to remove them. Second, if the trust does not grant you the right to remove the trustee, it may grant another person the right to remove. Sometimes that other person may serve in the role of what is known as a &#8220;trust protector&#8221; or &#8220;trust advisor.&#8221; If that is in the trust document you should speak to that person and let them know why you want the trustee removed. They would need to decide if they should do so or not. Finally, if neither of those is an option, your state law may have provisions that permit you to remove a trustee. However, it may be that you will have to file a petition with a court and seek a court order. You should hire an attorney to research this for you and advise you of the likelihood of success.<\/p>\n<p>Another option may be to simply ask the named trustee to resign. They may do so voluntarily.<\/p>\n<p>Assuming the trustee is removed, whether by you, a trust protector, or by court order, or if the trustee resigns, the next issue is who is to serve as the successor trustee. Again, looking at the terms of the trust should answer that question. Perhaps a successor is specifically named or perhaps the trust provides the procedure to appoint the successor. Before proceeding, you will want to make certain you know who will step-in as the new trustee.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In creating a trust, the trustmaker must name a trustee who has the legal obligation to administer it in accordance with the trustmaker&rsquo;s wishes and intentions.
