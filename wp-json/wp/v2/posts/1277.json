It is important to be realistic about the driving abilities of loved ones as they reach a certain stage and to prepare accordingly. Not only will it keep seniors safe, but planning ahead will help them financially as they make other arrangements for transportation.<\/p>\n<p>The first step is to reduce the need to drive. Find ways to bring the things they need right to them, like ordering groceries online for delivery and encouraging in-home appointments. Suggest that they invite friends and family over for regular visits instead of going out. They may be surprised by how many things are possible from the comfort of their own home.<\/p>\n<p>For the times your loved ones need to, or want to, venture elsewhere, look into other transportation options. Although there is usually no need to quit driving all at once, look to family, friends, taxis, and public transportation when you can, especially for longer trips. Use the money you&rsquo;ve been saving, along with what would have been spent on gas, on alternate modes of transportation. Their town may even have designated senior transportation services.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The time to start making this transition may be sooner than you or your loved ones think. Don&rsquo;t wait until an accident leaves them with no alternative. It may be time to start talking about limiting driving if they report noticing subtle difficulties, like trouble reading traffic signs or delayed breaking. Keep an eye out for small dings in your loved one&rsquo;s car or surrounding items, like the mailbox or garage door, along with slower response time or difficulty finding their way around familiar territory. Ask them to watch for these things as well.<\/p>\n<p>Asking a loved one to turn over their keys can be tough but with an open dialogue, the right support system and reasonable alternatives in place to ensure that they can continue to live an active lifestyle, a smooth transition is feasible. &nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We all want to be in control, to go where we want at our leisure. &nbsp;As we age, however, our senses and reaction times begin to slow which can make getting behind the wheel increasingly hazardous.
