The end of someone\u2019s life is not a topic anyone looks forward to discussing. It is, however, an important conversation that must be had so that the family understands \u00a0the testator\u2019s final wishes before he or she passes away. If a significant sum is being left to someone or some entity outside of the family, an explanation of this action may go a long way to avoiding a contested will. In a similar vein, if one heir is receiving a larger share of the estate than the others, it is prudent to have this action explained. If funds are being placed in a trust instead of given directly to the heirs, it makes sense for the testator to advise his or her loved ones in advance.<\/p>\n<p>When a loved one dies, people are often in a state of emotional turmoil. Each deals with grief differently and, often, unpredictably. Anger is a common reaction to loss, one of the five stages postulated to apply to everyone dealing with such a tragedy. Simply by talking to loved ones ahead of time, a testator can preempt any anger misdirected at the estate plan and avoid an unnecessary dispute, be it a small family tiff or a prolonged legal battle.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/auburnhillselderlaw.com\/auburn-rochester-hills-troy-mi-elder-law-lawyer_pa14229.htm\">The executor of the estate<\/a> must be privy to a significant amount of information before a testator passes on. It is helpful for the executor to know that he or she has been chosen for this role\u00a0 and to have accepted the appointment in advance. The executor should know the location of the original will. Concerns of fraud mean that only the original copy of a will can be entered into probate. The executor should be aware of all bank accounts, assets, and debts in a testator\u2019s name. This will avoid a tedious search for documents after the decedent passes on and will ensure that all assets are included as part of the estate. The executor of an estate should be aware of all memberships, because it will be the executor\u2019s responsibility to cancel them. An up-to-date accounting of all assets and debts will simplify the settlement of the estate for an executor significantly.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The conversation about a person\u2019s last wishes can be a difficult one for both the individual who is the topic of conversation and his or her loved ones.
