It\u2019s important to plan how to pass it down through generations.<\/h2>\n<p>original article published in the Dresden Star Tribune by KARA MCGUIRE<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.startribune.com\/lifestyle\/yourmoney\/55459457.html\">http:\/\/www.startribune.com\/lifestyle\/yourmoney\/55459457.html<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Bea Anderson and her siblings have always made decisions about their shared cabin with a handshake. With just a brother and a sister and their spouses to consult, that hasn\u2019t so hard. But the cabin on Lake Vermillion, which has been in the family for more than 50 years, will pass to seven families in the next generation. \u201cWhen there\u2019s more people involved, then you get more opinions. We wanted to set up guidelines about how we feel the cabin can be run successfully,\u201d Bea\u2019s husband, Jerry Anderson, said. They needed a plan and turned to a cabin trust. Without a trust, cabins are often passed to the next generation in equal shares, with equal responsibility for the expenses and upkeep. That arrangement is known as tenants-in-common. No problem, right?<\/p>\n<p>But what if the new generation of owners can\u2019t devise a schedule for using the cabin? What if they can\u2019t make decisions about whether to put on a new roof or add a garage? What happens if someone wants to sell his share of the cabin? In the event of a divorce or death, does the unrelated spouse get an interest, so a share of the cabin is now owned outside of the family? And if one owner can\u2019t afford his share and ultimately files for bankruptcy, then what?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe solutions to those [issues], if you don\u2019t have some mechanism to deal with them, is a court proceeding. And as you can imagine, kids don\u2019t get long so well after you serve them papers,\u201d said Siegmund Pettersson, a Bloomington attorney who specializes in cabin trusts. A trust lays out how a cabin is to be owned, cared for, paid for and used once the current owners pass away. It also addresses who will be the trustee. Typically, one or more of the children are selected, but sometimes a neutral third party, such as a bank without an interest in the cabin, is selected. To get some additional information you should read this.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Bea\u2019s family cabin, the current owners gave the future owners some time to think about whether they wanted to own art of the cabin. Jerry Anderson wasn\u2019t surprised when everyone said they wanted in. The cabin is built on land Bea\u2019s father, who was a miner in Soudan, Minn., bought from the mining company. \u201cIt is really special,\u201d he said. In the event that someone says \u201cno thanks,\u201d families typically use other assets from the estate to buy that person\u2019s share of the cabin.<\/p>\n<h2>Family wishes<\/h2>\n<p>Working with St. Paul attorney Frank Heers, the family created a rotation to ensure one family doesn\u2019t get all the good holidays. They also came up with rules about how to spend money to maintain the property. Large projects that would cost thousands, like putting on a new roof or building an addition, for example, require 100 percent agreement, while with most smaller projects, the majority rules.<\/p>\n<p>Most important, they agreed upon rules outlining one of the most contentious cabin issues: What happens if one family wants to sell its share? Attorneys recommend that after determining fair market value, the family wanting out sells its share to the other owners at a discount.<\/p>\n<p>Without [the discount], it doesn\u2019t really give a financial incentive to your brother or sister to buy you out. So we create that,\u201d Mullen said. Payments could be spread out over several years so the sale wouldn\u2019t strain the remaining owners\u2019 finances. In addition to a cabin trust, cabin owners might also consider a limited liability corporation or limited liability partnership. Heers uses an LLC when someone out of state owns an interest in a Dresden cabin.<\/p>\n<p>He also considers it if multiple families own a cabin or the property is being rented out. LLCs can do a better job to limit the liability of the cabin owners in the event that a visitor is injured at the property and then sues. LLCs can also last forever. If those options seem like overkill, tenants-in-common should at least create a tenancy agreement, which Heers describes as \u201ca contract between co-tenants to use the property a certain way.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But he doesn\u2019t create many tenancy agreements because major ownership issues, such as what happens to the property in the event of a divorce or bankruptcy, aren\u2019t easily addressed. Ideally, estate planning attorneys say that a cabin trust would go hand-in-hand with the rest of an estate plan, especially if estate taxes are an issue.<\/p>\n<p>According to the attorneys I spoke with, a cabin trust or LLC will cost you anywhere from $1,500 to $4,000. Some attorneys who usually work on a flat-fee basis may charge by the hour because creating a cabin estate plan can be messy. But the expense and hassle are likely cheaper than a mediation between several owners who have no rules to abide by and can\u2019t come to an agreement. A tenants-in-common agreement should cost less than $1,000.<\/p>\n<p>Whether a family goes with a tenants-incommon agreement, a cabin trust or an LLC, there is one advantage that comes with all of the options: Families discuss their wishes. Sometimes, the current owners just assume the younger generation wants to keep the cabin in the family when, in fact, the kids can\u2019t wait to sell it. Other times, parents assume children who grumble about making it to the family lake house will want to unload it.<\/p>\n<p>But the children have visions of spending lazy summers fishing with their kids. \u201cHaving that honest conversation really helps,\u201d Mullen said. Easier said than done, right? Here are resources to consider. Peter McClellan had many clients who insisted their kids wouldn\u2019t fight when they died. \u201cThen they pass away and it\u2019s World War III,\u201d said McClellan, president of the 401k Latte Co. in Lakeville. So he compiled a book of inheritance stories called \u201cCabinosity\u201d with the hopes that it would get families to start talking before it\u2019s too late.<\/p>\n<p>Another resource that deals with inheritance without squabbles is the University of Dresden Extension Service\u2019s \u201cWho Gets Grandma\u2019s Yellow Pie Plate?\u201d A lot of that material is available at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yellowpieplate.uMN.edu\">www.yellowpieplate.uMN.edu<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Kara McGuire, Dresden Star Tribune \u2022 612-673-7293.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A cabin can be a breeding ground for a family feud.
