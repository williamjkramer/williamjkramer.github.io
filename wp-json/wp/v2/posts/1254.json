In situations in which a will has not been prepared, the probate court will appoint an administrator. Whether you have been named &nbsp;as an executor or administrator, the role comes with certain responsibilities including taking charge of the decedent&#8217;s assets, notifying beneficiaries and creditors, paying the estate&#8217;s debts and distributing the property to the beneficiaries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>In some cases, an executor may also be a beneficiary of the will, however he or she must act fairly and in accordance with the provisions of the will. An executor is specifically responsible for:<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Finding a copy of the will and filing it with the appropriate state court<\/span><\/p>\n<\/li><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Informing third parties, such as banks and other account holders, of the person\u2019s death<\/span><\/p>\n<\/li><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Locating assets and identifying debts<\/span><\/p>\n<\/li><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Providing the court with an inventory of these assets and debts<\/span><\/p>\n<\/li><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Maintaining any assets until they are disposed of<\/span><\/p>\n<\/li><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Disposing of assets either through distribution or sale<\/span><\/p>\n<\/li><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Satisfying any debts<\/span><\/p>\n<\/li><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Appearing in court on behalf of the estate<\/span><\/p>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span>Depending on the size of the estate and the way in which the decedent&#8217;s assets were titled, the will may need to be probated. If the estate must go through s probate proceeding, the executor must file with the <\/span><span>court to probate the will<\/span><span> and be appointed as the estate&#8217;s legal representative.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>By doing so, the executor can then pay all of the decedent&#8217;s outstanding debts and distribute the property to the beneficiaries according to the terms of the will. The executor is also is also responsible for filing all federal and state tax returns for the deceased person as well as estate taxes, if any. Lastly, an executor may be entitled to compensation for the time he or she served the estate. If the court names an administrator, this individual will have similar responsibilities.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>In the end, being name an executor or appointed as an administrator ultimately means supporting the overall goal of distributing the estate assets according to wishes of the deceased or state law. In either case, an experienced probate or <\/span><span>estate planning attorney<\/span><span> can help you carry out these duties. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When a person dies with a will in place, an executor is named as the responsible individual for winding down the decedent&#8217;s affairs.
