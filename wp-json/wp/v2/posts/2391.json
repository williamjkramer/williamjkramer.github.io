It is important to select trustworthy fiduciaries who will appropriately manage your cryptocurrency after you pass away.  It is also vital to include language in your estate plan that permits your fiduciaries to access your digital records to administer cryptocurrency in your estate.  If your fiduciary uses your passcode without the proper permissions, they could be breaking the law.  Finally, it is a good idea to create a cryptocurrency access guide for your fiduciary. This should include information on the types of cryptocurrencies you own, the number of shares, and how to locate and access your cryptocurrency accounts.  It is a good idea to write this information down and store it in a secure (but accessible) location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>If you have any questions about cryptocurrency or addressing it in your estate plan, please contact our firm.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is Cryptocurrency?
