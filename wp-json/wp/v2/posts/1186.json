It is important that the treasured family vacation home be considered as part of a thorough estate plan. In many cases, the owner wants to ensure that the vacation home remains within the family after his or her death, and not be sold as part of an estate liquidation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are generally two ways to do this: Within a revocable living trust, a popular option is to create a separate sub-trust called a &#8220;Cabin Trust&#8221; that will come into existence upon the death of the original owner(s). The vacation home would then be transferred into this Trust, along with a specific amount of money that will cover the cost of upkeep for the vacation home for a certain period of time. The Trust should also designate who may use the vacation home (usually the children or grandchildren). Usually, when a child dies, his\/her right to use the property would pass to his\/her children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cabin Trust should also name a Trustee, who would be responsible for the general management of the property and the funds retained for upkeep of the vacation home. The Trust can specify what will happen when the Cabin Trust money runs out, and the circumstances under which the vacation property can be sold. Often the Trust will allow the children the first option to buy the property.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another method of preserving the family vacation home is the creation of a Limited Liability Partnership to hold the house. The parents can assign shares to their children, and provide for a mechanism to determine how to pay for the vacation home taxes and upkeep. An LLP provides protection from liability, in case someone is injured on the property.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is always wise to consult with an estate planning attorney about how to best protect and preserve a vacation home for future generations.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many people own a family vacation home&#8211;a lakeside cabin, a beachfront condo&#8211;a place where parents, children and grandchildren can gather for vacations, holidays and a bit of relaxation.
