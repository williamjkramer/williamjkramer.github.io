In most states, the individual&#8217;s assets are split &#8212; with one third of the estate going to the spouse and all surviving children splitting the rest. For people who leave behind large estates, unless they have established trusts or other tax avoidance protections, there may be a tremendous tax liability, including both estate and inheritance tax.<\/p>\n<p>For just about everyone, the cost of having a will prepared by a skilled and knowledgeable attorney is negligible when compared to the cost of dying <em>intestate<\/em>,\u00a0 since there are a number of serious consequences involved in dying without a proper will in place.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Legal Consequences<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The larger your estate, the more catastrophic the consequences of dying <em>intestate<\/em> will be. If you die without a will, the freedom to decide how your property will be divided will be taken from you and the state in which you reside will divide your assets.<\/p>\n<p>Not only will you not be able to decide on the distribution of your property, but a stranger will be making personal, familial decisions. This may be divisive among your family members; instead of leaving your loved ones in peace, you may leave them engaged in bitter disputes over a family heirloom or even a simple memento. This can be especially true in situations where there are children from a previous marriage.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Tax Consequences<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>In addition to the legal and personal problems associated with dying <em>intestate<\/em>, the tax results can be severe as well. This is particularly true for clients who have not consulted with an estate planning attorney in order to protect themselves through tax avoidance methods. Both the state and federal governments can tax the transfer of property and an inheritance tax may be imposed on the property you have left to your heirs.<\/p>\n<p>The most effective way to avoid all of these negative tax consequences is to create a will with a competent attorney. Your lawyer will help you to choose a proper executor (the person who will administer your estate, distribute your property and pay your debts), and will assist you in finding ways to limit your tax liability. There are several ways your attorney can help you to do this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By gifting some of those you want to inherit before you die<\/li>\n<li>By creating one or several trusts<\/li>\n<li>By purchasing a life insurance policy<\/li>\n<li>By buying investments in your loved one&#8217;s name<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These methods will ensure that your loved ones receive the assets you desire them to have, while simultaneously protecting them from possibly enormous tax burdens after you pass.<\/p>\n<p>For those who have no family, dying without a will can be even more troublesome and costly, since their entire fortunes can be left to the state. If a genealogical search doesn&#8217;t turn up any blood relatives, all of your assets will be claimed by the government. This means that any individual, group, organization or charity you wished to endow will receive nothing.<\/p>\n<p>It is never easy to think of one&#8217;s own mortality, but it is even more painful to contemplate leaving a messy, uncomfortable situation behind when you pass. By engaging the services of an excellent estate planning attorney, who will help you fashion a legally binding, precisely designed document,\u00a0 you can make sure that your loved ones are well taken care of and that your final wishes are respected and implemented.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When someone dies without a will, it is known as dying intestate.\u00a0 In such
