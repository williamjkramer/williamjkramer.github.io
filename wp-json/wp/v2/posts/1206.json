If you had life insurance, for example, your family would not be able to access those funds until the probate process was complete.\u00a0 A couple of basic estate planning documents can keep your estate out of the probate court and get your assets into the hands of your chosen beneficiaries much more quickly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You have social media accounts<\/strong>.\u00a0 Many people spend a great deal of time online, conversing with friends, storing important photos and documents and even managing finances. Without instructions from you, will your family know what to do with your Facebook account, your LinkedIn account, and so forth?<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nYou want to give money or possessions to friends or charities<\/strong>.\u00a0 When someone dies without a will, there are laws that dictate who will receive any assets.\u00a0 These recipients will include immediate family members like parents, siblings, and a spouse.\u00a0 If you want to give assets to friends or to a charity, you must protect your wishes with a will.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You care about what happens to you if you are in a coma or persistent vegetative state<\/strong>.\u00a0 We all see the stories on the news \u2013 ugly fights within families over the prostrate bodies of critically ill children or siblings or spouses.\u00a0 When you write your will, write a health care directive (also called a living will) and a financial power of attorney as well.\u00a0 This is especially important if you have a life
