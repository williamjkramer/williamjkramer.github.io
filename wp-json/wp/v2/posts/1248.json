Generally, the executor\u2019s responsibilities involve taking charge of the deceased person\u2019s assets, notifying beneficiaries and creditors, paying the estate\u2019s debts and distributing the property to the beneficiaries. The executor may also be a beneficiary of the Will, though he or she must treat all beneficiaries fairly and in accordance with the provisions of the Will.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>First and foremost, an executor must obtain the original, signed Will as well as other important documents such as certified copies of the Death Certificate.\u00a0 The executor must notify all persons who have an interest in the estate or who are named as beneficiaries in the Will. A list of all assets must be compiled, including value at the date of death. The executor must take steps to secure all assets, whether by taking possession of them, or by obtaining adequate insurance. Assets of the estate include all real and personal property owned by the decedent; overlooked assets sometimes include stocks, bonds, pension funds, bank accounts, safety deposit boxes, annuity payments, holiday pay, and work-related life insurance or survivor benefits.<\/p>\n<p>The executor is responsible for compiling a list of the decedent\u2019s debts, as well. Debts can include credit card accounts, loan payments, mortgages, home utilities, tax arrears, alimony and outstanding leases. All of the decedent\u2019s creditors must also be notified and given an opportunity to make a claim against the estate.<\/p>\n<p>Whether the Will must be probated depends on a variety of factors, including size of the estate and how the decedent\u2019s assets were titled. An experienced probate or estate planning attorney can help determine whether probate is required, and assist with carrying out the executor\u2019s duties. If the estate must go through probate, the executor must file with the court to probate the Will and be appointed as the estate\u2019s legal representative.\u00a0 Once the executor has this legal authority, he or she must pay all of the decedent\u2019s outstanding debts, provided there are sufficient assets in the estate. After debts have been paid, the executor must distribute the remaining real and personal property to the beneficiaries, in accordance with the wishes set forth in the Will. Because the executor is accountable to the beneficiaries of the estate, it is extremely important to keep complete, accurate records of all expenditures, correspondence, asset distribution, and filings with the court and government agencies.<\/p>\n<p>The executor is also responsible for filing all tax returns for the deceased person including federal and state income tax returns and estate tax filings, if applicable. Additional tasks may include notifying carriers for homeowner\u2019s and auto insurance policies and initiating claims on life insurance policies.<\/p>\n<p>The executor is entitled to compensation for his or her services.\u00a0 This fee varies according to the estate\u2019s size and may be subject to review depending on the complexity as well as the time and effort expended by the executor.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An executor is the person designated in a Will as the individual who is responsible for performing a number of tasks necessary to wind down the decedent\u2019s affairs.
