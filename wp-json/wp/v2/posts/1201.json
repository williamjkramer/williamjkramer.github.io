in fact, it often cannot even accomplish the most common goals. \u00a0This fact often surprises people who are going through the estate planning process for the first time. \u00a0In addition to a last will and testament, there are other important planning tools which are necessary to ensure your estate planning wishes are honored.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Beneficiary Designations<br \/>\n<\/strong><em>Do you have a pension plan, 401(k), life insurance, a bank account with a pay-on-death directive, or investments in transfer-on-death (TOD) form?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>When you established each of these accounts, you designated at least one beneficiary of the account in the event of your death. \u00a0You cannot use your will to change or override the beneficiary designations of such accounts. \u00a0Instead, you must change them directly with the bank or company that holds the account.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Special Needs Trusts<br \/>\n<\/strong><em>Do you have a child or other beneficiary with special needs?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Leaving money directly to a beneficiary who has long-term special medical needs may threaten his or her ability to qualify for government benefits and may also create an unnecessary tax burden. \u00a0A simple vehicle called a special needs trust is a more effective way to care for an adult child with special needs after your death.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conditional Giving with Living or Testamentary Trusts<br \/>\n<\/strong><em>Do you want to place conditions on some of your bequests?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you want your children or other beneficiaries to receive an inheritance only if they meet or continually meet certain prerequisites, you must utilize a trust, either one established during your lifetime (living trust) or one created through instructions provided in a will (testamentary trust).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Estate Tax Planning<br \/>\n<\/strong><em>Do you expect your estate to owe estate taxes?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>A basic will cannot help you lower the estate tax burden on your assets after death. \u00a0If you think your estate will be liable to pay taxes, you can take steps during your lifetime to minimize that burden on your beneficiaries. \u00a0Certain trusts operate to minimize estate taxes, and you may choose to make some gifts during your lifetime for tax-related reasons.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship<br \/>\n<\/strong><em>Do you own a house with someone \u201cin joint tenancy\u201d?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cJoint tenancy\u201d is the most common form of house ownership with a spouse. \u00a0This form of ownership is also known as \u201cjoint tenancy with right of survivorship,\u201d \u201ctenancy in the entirety,\u201d or \u201ccommunity property with right of survivorship.\u201d \u00a0When you die, your ownership share in the house passes directly to your spouse (or the other co-owner). \u00a0A provision in your will bequeathing your ownership share to a third party will not have any effect.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pet Trusts<br \/>\n<\/strong><em>Do you want to leave money to your pets or companion animals?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Pets are generally considered property, and you cannot use your will to leave property (money) to other property (pets). \u00a0Instead, you can use your will to name a caretaker for your animals and to leave a sum of money to that person for the animals\u2019 care.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A basic last will and testament cannot accomplish every goal of estate planning;
