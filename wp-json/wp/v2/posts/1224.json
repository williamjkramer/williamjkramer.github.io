Preserving Peace in the Family"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>The purpose of writing a Last Will and Testament is to make sure that you \u2013 and not an anonymous probate court judge \u2013 have control over the distribution of your property after your death.&nbsp; If one or more family members disputes the instructions in your will, however, then it is possible&nbsp; that a probate court judge may decide how your assets will be distributed.<\/p>\n<p>\tProtect yourself, your family members and your last wishes by taking steps to prevent a will contest after your death.&nbsp; Will contests (this is the legal term used to describe a family member\u2019s challenge to the contents of a will) can be based on one or more of these claims:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\t\tThe will was not properly executed<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tThe willmaker was under improper or undue influence from a beneficiary<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tThe willmaker or another person committed fraud<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tThe willmaker lacked the mental capacity to make the will<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n\tThere are a number of steps that you can take to help prevent will contests based on any of those claims.&nbsp; It is important to remember, though, that different states have different laws regarding wills and probate.&nbsp; What is advisable in one state may be inadvisable in another, which is why the first suggestion for preventing a will contest is:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>Obtain qualified legal advice regarding your estate plan<\/strong>.&nbsp; Estate planning has become a popular \u201cdo it yourself\u201d legal task, but you should at least consider having your will reviewed \u2013 if not written \u2013 by a qualified estate planning lawyer.&nbsp; Writing your will with the help of an estate planning attorney will also ensure that your will is a properly executed and valid legal document.<br \/>\n\t\t&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>Don\u2019t delay estate planning<\/strong>.&nbsp; Plan your estate while you are in good health \u2013 \u201cof sound mind and body.\u201d&nbsp; If you create your will while your physical or mental health is failing, your will becomes vulnerable to claims that it is invalid due to your lack of mental capacity.<br \/>\n\t\t&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>Consider a no-contest clause<\/strong>.&nbsp; A no-contest clause (also called an in terroreum clause) in a Last Will and Testament disinherits anyone who contests the will.&nbsp; Keep in mind, though, that no-contest clauses are valid in some states but not in others.<br \/>\n\t\t&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>Consider using trusts<\/strong>.&nbsp; Trusts are becoming more widely usedin estate planning , and are useful for various situations.&nbsp; A will is a public document once it is filed in probate court, and the public nature of the document can give rise to disputes and will contests.&nbsp; In contrast, a revocable living trust is a personal and private document that does not have to be filed as a public record.&nbsp; Furthermore, lifetime trusts can be used to provide financially for \u201ctroublesome\u201d beneficiaries who might otherwise spend through their inheritance.&nbsp; Lifetime trusts are flexible and can link financial inheritance to the accomplishment of goals that you set forth in the trust documents.<br \/>\n\t\t&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>Write your will independently<\/strong>.&nbsp; To avoid claims of undue influence after your death, make sure you write your will in circumstances that are clearly free from interference by family members or other beneficiaries.&nbsp; Avoid having beneficiaries serve as witnesses, for example, and don\u2019t allow beneficiaries to attend your meetings with your estate planning attorney.&nbsp; This is especially important if you are under the care of a family member who is also a beneficiary.<br \/>\n\t\t&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>Be of sound mind and body<\/strong>.&#038;n<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The purpose of writing a Last Will and Testament is to make sure that you \u2013 and not an anonymous probate court judge \u2013 have control over the distribution of&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[17],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.6 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Preventing a Will Contest &amp;
