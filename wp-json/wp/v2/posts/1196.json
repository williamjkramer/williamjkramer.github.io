Think Again"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>You\u2019ve had an attorney draft your estate planning documents, including your living trust and will. Probate avoidance and tax saving strategies have been implemented. Your documents are signed, notarized and witnessed in accordance with all applicable laws, and are stored in a location known to your chosen executor or estate administrator. Your work is done, right? Not exactly.<\/p>\n<p>Although treasure hunts may be fun for youngsters, the fiduciaries of your estate will not find inventorying your assets to be nearly as exciting. When it comes time to settle your affairs, your estate representatives will be charged with the responsibility to gather and manage your assets, pay off debts and taxes, and distribute your assets to your named beneficiaries. This can be a tall order for an outsider who is likely unaware of the full scope of your assets.<\/p>\n<p>If your fiduciaries cannot determine exactly what property you own, and its value and location, you are setting up your loved ones for a frustrating treasure hunt that can delay the settlement of your estate and rack up additional estate-related expenses. You may be remembered for the frustration of locating your assets, rather than the gifts made upon your death \u2013 not a legacy many wish to leave.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, as you are establishing your estate plan take the extra time to record a comprehensive asset inventory and make sure those who will be responsible for settling your estate know where that inventory is stored. Do not presume that everything is handled once you meet with a lawyer and sign your documents. The legal instruments you have gone to the time, trouble and expense to prepare are practically worthless if your assets cannot be identified, located and transferred to your beneficiaries. However, creating a thoughtful asset inventory will aid your loved ones in closing your estate and honoring your memory.<\/p>\n<p>Nobody knows better what assets you own than you. And who better than you to know an item\u2019s value, age or location? Your fiduciaries may not have the benefit of tax or registration renewal notices for titled assets, and certainly won\u2019t have copies of the titles or deeds \u2013 unless you provide them. It\u2019s a good idea to include copies of the following items with your asset inventory:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deeds to real property<\/li>\n<li>Titles to personal property<\/li>\n<li>Statements for bank, brokerage, credit card and retirement accounts<\/li>\n<li>Stock certificates<\/li>\n<li>Life insurance policy<\/li>\n<li>Tax notices<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For each of the above assets you should also list names and contact information for individuals who can assist with each the underlying assets, such as real estate attorneys, brokers, financial planners and accountants.<\/p>\n<p>If your estate includes unique objects or valuable family heirlooms, a professional appraisal can help you plan your estate, and help your representatives settle your estate. If you have any property appraised, include a copy of the report with your asset inventory.<\/p>\n<p>Care should be taken to continually update your asset inventory as things change. There will likely be many years between the time your estate plan is created and the day your fiduciaries must step in and settle your estate. Properties may be bought or sold, and these changes should be reflected in your asset inventory on an ongoing basis.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You\u2019ve had an attorney draft your estate planning documents, including your living trust and will.
