Substitutes"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>In states that have \u201celective share statutes,\u201d a surviving spouse is legally entitled to a certain percentage of the deceased&#8217;s estate, even if that spouse has attempted to disinherit or to provide a lesser bequest, or gift, under the will.\u00a0 In \u201cseparate property\u201d states, an elective share statute is likely to be in effect.\u00a0 If the estate in question is valued at $50,000 or less, the elective share is likely to be the actual amount of the net estate.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTestamentary substitutes\u201d are removed from particular assets that would otherwise pass to the surviving spouse.\u00a0 Assets passing by will or through intestacy could cause a reduction in the elective share amount as well.\u00a0 Totten trusts, such as Payable-On-Death Bank Accounts (PODs), Retirement or joint bank accounts, gifts <em>causa mortis<\/em> (&#8220;gifts made by the decedent in contemplation of death,\u201d) U.S. savings bonds, jointly held property, and gifts or transfers that were made approximately one year prior to death, are some examples of testamentary substitutes.<\/p>\n<p>If a gift was made about one year prior to death, yet involves medical or educational expenses, then the gift may not qualify as a true testamentary substitute.\u00a0 With regard to PODs, the spouse, offspring, or grandchildren will be named as beneficiaries. \u00a0The funds of a POD are only distributed upon the decedent\u2019s death.\u00a0\u00a0 Testamentary Trusts are listed in the will until the designated property passes to the trust upon the testator\u2019s death.<\/p>\n<p>Generally, a gift <em>causa mortis<\/em> is only active upon the decedent\u2019s expected death and is typically revocable.\u00a0 Moreover, certain elements must exist to create a valid gift <em>causa mortis<\/em>.\u00a0 These include an intent to create \u201can immediate transfer of ownership,\u201d valid delivery, acceptance of the gift by the donee, and the donor\u2019s \u201canticipation of imminent death.\u201d\u00a0 There are also certain circumstances by which gifts <em>causa mortis<\/em> are not valid.\u00a0 For example, if the donee passes away before the donor, it is unlikely that a property interest was transferred. \u00a0Gifts <em>causa mortis <\/em>are also taxed as if the testator had listed the gifts in his or her will.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, testamentary substitutes are generally put back into the net estate total to determine the elective share amount that the surviving spouse will collect.\u00a0 The aforementioned may vary if property is held jointly, as joint tenants or otherwise, because the spouse may have a right of survivorship in the property.\u00a0 Estate planning attorneys are aware of all the ins and outs of testamentary substitutes and how they may affect the distribution of your assets. \u00a0It is useful, if not essential, to consult with a knowledgeable attorney when making arrangements regarding testamentary substitutes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In states that have \u201celective share statutes,\u201d a surviving spouse is legally entitled to
