It\u2019s not at all uncommon to find people with a filing cabinet or even a shoe box containing passports, account statements, deeds, tax returns, birth certificates and social security cards. Wills are often added to these files once the estate planning process is completed. In choosing to store your important estate planning documents at home, however, you risk having the originals lost or destroyed in the case of fire, flooding or theft. So what happens if the original version of your will is lost or ruined?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally when a person dies, state law determines what must happen in the state probate proceeding. In most cases, the &#8220;original&#8221; of the will must be submitted to the probate court in the county where the person resided. If the original of the will cannot be located and provided to the court, there likely is a provision in your state&#8217;s probate code that would permit the submission of a photocopy of that signed will.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In many cases, the attorney who prepared the will maintains a copy of the estate planning documents. Assuming, that the copy your attorney has could be submitted to the probate court, additional steps may need to be taken, and additional pleadings prepared in order to submit a copy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should you lose the original copy of your will, the best practice would be for you to execute a new will which would make things easier for your family and loved ones upon your death. In that case there would be better assurances that your wishes were followed and carried out. Preparing a new will should not take much time for your attorney. He or she likely still has the word processing file on his or her computer, and could easily modify it for you to execute again. If for some reason this is not done, you may wish to execute a document stating the original was destroyed in a flood or fire but that you did not intend to revoke it. However, it\u2019s important to note that this may not be effective in every instance as many states have very strict requirements in terms of requiring originals and execution formalities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep the originals of your estate planning documents safe, even in the face of disaster, you might consider purchasing a fireproof\/waterproof safe for your home or rent a safe deposit box with a local bank where you can still easily access your documents but keep them secure off-site.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many people keep their important documents at home where they are easily accessible.
