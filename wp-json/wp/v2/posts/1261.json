Ademption describes what happens when something designated in a will no longer exists. Say, for example, your uncle dies and leaves for you in his will an old-school Harley Davidson motorcycle. However, if your uncle crashed the motorcycle two years before the will was probated and there\u2019s nothing to leave, then that gift would be considered adeemed and you would receive nothing. This is why certain wills include language that says, \u201cif owned by me at my death.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>However, it is important to realize that certain items cannot be adeemed. For instance, money. If your uncle died and left $7,000 for you in his will, but left a zero dollar balance in his accounts, your gift of cash would not be adeemed. Instead, the estate would be responsible for satisfying that gift, say for example, through the sale of the house or other such property.<\/p>\n<p>There are exceptions to ademption, however. If the property leaves the estate after the person who wrote the will has been declared incompetent, ademption is waived.&nbsp; Other states make exceptions for cases where interest in a corporation that no longer exists because the shares were exchanged with that of an acquiring company.&nbsp; Your state may tackle ademption differently based on its laws, so please consult a qualified real estate or probate lawyer if you want to learn more about ademption and its exceptions.<br \/> &nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you\u2019re involved in settling a loved one\u2019s estate, you may come across the curious word \u201cademption\u201d.
