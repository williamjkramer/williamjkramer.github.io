The funds from these trusts are not directly accessible by the beneficiary. Instead, they are intended to pay for expenses that go beyond what is covered by government programs, ensuring a better quality of life for the beneficiary without disqualifying them from essential benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are Special Needs Trusts?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Special Needs Trusts, commonly abbreviated as &#8220;SNTs&#8221; but distinct from Supplemental Needs Trusts, are designed primarily to manage assets for someone with a disability, ensuring they receive the care and lifestyle they deserve without compromising their entitlement to federal assistance programs. The primary difference lies in the source of the funds; a Special Needs Trust typically contains assets belonging to the person with the disability, often received through an inheritance, lawsuit, or other means.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why are Special &amp; Supplemental Needs Trusts important?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Special and Supplemental Needs Trusts play a pivotal role in estate planning for families with members having disabilities. These trusts ensure that a person with special needs can have access to additional funds to enhance their quality of life without endangering their access to vital public benefit programs. Without such trusts, direct inheritances or lump sum awards can inadvertently disqualify individuals from receiving the necessary benefits, often causing more harm than good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How William J Kramer, L.L.C.
