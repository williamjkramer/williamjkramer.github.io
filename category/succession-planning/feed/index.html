										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A cabin can be a breeding ground for a family feud. It’s important to plan how to pass it down through generations.</h2>
<p>original article published in the Dresden Star Tribune by KARA MCGUIRE<br />
<a href="http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/yourmoney/55459457.html">http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/yourmoney/55459457.html</a></p>
<p>Bea Anderson and her siblings have always made decisions about their shared cabin with a handshake. With just a brother and a sister and their spouses to consult, that hasn’t so hard. But the cabin on Lake Vermillion, which has been in the family for more than 50 years, will pass to seven families in the next generation. “When there’s more people involved, then you get more opinions. We wanted to set up guidelines about how we feel the cabin can be run successfully,” Bea’s husband, Jerry Anderson, said. They needed a plan and turned to a cabin trust. Without a trust, cabins are often passed to the next generation in equal shares, with equal responsibility for the expenses and upkeep. That arrangement is known as tenants-in-common. No problem, right?</p>
<p>But what if the new generation of owners can’t devise a schedule for using the cabin? What if they can’t make decisions about whether to put on a new roof or add a garage? What happens if someone wants to sell his share of the cabin? In the event of a divorce or death, does the unrelated spouse get an interest, so a share of the cabin is now owned outside of the family? And if one owner can’t afford his share and ultimately files for bankruptcy, then what?</p>
<p>“The solutions to those [issues], if you don’t have some mechanism to deal with them, is a court proceeding. And as you can imagine, kids don’t get long so well after you serve them papers,” said Siegmund Pettersson, a Bloomington attorney who specializes in cabin trusts. A trust lays out how a cabin is to be owned, cared for, paid for and used once the current owners pass away. It also addresses who will be the trustee. Typically, one or more of the children are selected, but sometimes a neutral third party, such as a bank without an interest in the cabin, is selected. To get some additional information you should read this.</p>
<p>In the case of Bea’s family cabin, the current owners gave the future owners some time to think about whether they wanted to own art of the cabin. Jerry Anderson wasn’t surprised when everyone said they wanted in. The cabin is built on land Bea’s father, who was a miner in Soudan, Minn., bought from the mining company. “It is really special,” he said. In the event that someone says “no thanks,” families typically use other assets from the estate to buy that person’s share of the cabin.</p>
<h2>Family wishes</h2>
<p>Working with St. Paul attorney Frank Heers, the family created a rotation to ensure one family doesn’t get all the good holidays. They also came up with rules about how to spend money to maintain the property. Large projects that would cost thousands, like putting on a new roof or building an addition, for example, require 100 percent agreement, while with most smaller projects, the majority rules.</p>
<p>Most important, they agreed upon rules outlining one of the most contentious cabin issues: What happens if one family wants to sell its share? Attorneys recommend that after determining fair market value, the family wanting out sells its share to the other owners at a discount.</p>
<p>Without [the discount], it doesn’t really give a financial incentive to your brother or sister to buy you out. So we create that,” Mullen said. Payments could be spread out over several years so the sale wouldn’t strain the remaining owners’ finances. In addition to a cabin trust, cabin owners might also consider a limited liability corporation or limited liability partnership. Heers uses an LLC when someone out of state owns an interest in a Dresden cabin.</p>
<p>He also considers it if multiple families own a cabin or the property is being rented out. LLCs can do a better job to limit the liability of the cabin owners in the event that a visitor is injured at the property and then sues. LLCs can also last forever. If those options seem like overkill, tenants-in-common should at least create a tenancy agreement, which Heers describes as “a contract between co-tenants to use the property a certain way.”</p>
<p>But he doesn’t create many tenancy agreements because major ownership issues, such as what happens to the property in the event of a divorce or bankruptcy, aren’t easily addressed. Ideally, estate planning attorneys say that a cabin trust would go hand-in-hand with the rest of an estate plan, especially if estate taxes are an issue.</p>
<p>According to the attorneys I spoke with, a cabin trust or LLC will cost you anywhere from $1,500 to $4,000. Some attorneys who usually work on a flat-fee basis may charge by the hour because creating a cabin estate plan can be messy. But the expense and hassle are likely cheaper than a mediation between several owners who have no rules to abide by and can’t come to an agreement. A tenants-in-common agreement should cost less than $1,000.</p>
<p>Whether a family goes with a tenants-incommon agreement, a cabin trust or an LLC, there is one advantage that comes with all of the options: Families discuss their wishes. Sometimes, the current owners just assume the younger generation wants to keep the cabin in the family when, in fact, the kids can’t wait to sell it. Other times, parents assume children who grumble about making it to the family lake house will want to unload it.</p>
<p>But the children have visions of spending lazy summers fishing with their kids. “Having that honest conversation really helps,” Mullen said. Easier said than done, right? Here are resources to consider. Peter McClellan had many clients who insisted their kids wouldn’t fight when they died. “Then they pass away and it’s World War III,” said McClellan, president of the 401k Latte Co. in Lakeville. So he compiled a book of inheritance stories called “Cabinosity” with the hopes that it would get families to start talking before it’s too late.</p>
<p>Another resource that deals with inheritance without squabbles is the University of Dresden Extension Service’s “Who Gets Grandma’s Yellow Pie Plate?” A lot of that material is available at <a href="http://www.yellowpieplate.uMN.edu">www.yellowpieplate.uMN.edu</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Business succession plans contemplate and instruct regarding any changes in future ownership and management of a business. Most business owners know they should think about succession planning, but few actually end up doing so. It is hard to think about not being in charge of the business you have built up, but a proper succession plan can ensure that your business continues long after you are there to run it, providing an enduring legacy.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips to keep in mind when you begin to think about putting a succession plan into place for your business.</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper plans take time &#8211; often years &#8211; to develop and implement because there are many steps involved. It is really never too early to start thinking about how you want to hand off control of your business.</li>
<li>Succession plans are a waste of time unless they are more than a piece of paper. Involving attorneys, accountants and business advisors ensures that your plan is actually implemented.</li>
<li>There is no cookie-cutter succession plan that fits all businesses, and no one way to develop and implement a successful plan. Each business is unique, so each business needs a custom-made plan that fits the needs of all parties involved.</li>
<li>It may seem counterintuitive, but transferring a business between people who are familiar with the business &#8211; from one family member to another, or between business partners &#8211; is often more complicated than selling the business to a complete stranger. Emotional investments cannot be easily quantified, but their importance is real. Having a neutral party at the negotiating table can help everyone involved focus on what is best for the business and the people that are depending on it for their livelihood.</li>
<li>Once a succession plan has been established, it is critically important that the completed plan be continually reviewed and updated as circumstances change. This is one of the biggest reasons having an attorney on your succession planning team is important. Sound legal counsel can assist you in making periodic adjustments and maintaining an effective succession plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are ready to start thinking about succession planning, contact an experienced business law attorney today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine if writing a last will and testament were a pre-requisite to graduating from high school.  The graduate walks across the stage, hands the completed will to the principal, and gets the diploma in return.   It might sound strange because most 18 year olds have little in terms of assets but it’s a good idea for all adults to draft a last will and testament.</p>
<p>Graduation from college is another good milestone to use as a reminder to create an estate plan.  If you haven’t created a will by the time you marry – or are living with a partner in a committed relationship – then it’s fair to say you are overdue.</p>
<p>Think you don’t need an estate plan because you’re broke?  Not true.  Here are eight excellent reasons for young people to complete a last will and testament.  And they have very little to do with money.<br />
<strong><br />
You are entering the military</strong>.  Anyone entering the military, at 18 or any other age, should make sure his or her affairs are in order.  Even for an 18-year-old, that means creating a will and other basic estate planning documents like a health care directive and powers of attorney.<br />
<strong><br />
You received an inheritance</strong>.  You may not think of the inheritance as your asset, especially if it is held in trust for you.  But, without an estate plan, the disposition of that money will be a slow and complicated process for your surviving family members.<br />
<strong><br />
You own an animal</strong>.  It is common for people to include plans for their pets in their wills.  If the unthinkable were to happen and you died unexpectedly, what would happen to your beloved pet?  Better to plan ahead for your animals in the event of your death.  You can even direct the sale of specific assets, with the proceeds going to your pet’s new guardian for upkeep expenses.</p>
<p><strong>You want to protect your family from red tape</strong>.  If you die without a will, your family will have to take your “estate” (whatever money and possessions you have at the time of your death) through a long court process known as probate. If you had life insurance, for example, your family would not be able to access those funds until the probate process was complete.  A couple of basic estate planning documents can keep your estate out of the probate court and get your assets into the hands of your chosen beneficiaries much more quickly.</p>
<p><strong>You have social media accounts</strong>.  Many people spend a great deal of time online, conversing with friends, storing important photos and documents and even managing finances. Without instructions from you, will your family know what to do with your Facebook account, your LinkedIn account, and so forth?<br />
<strong><br />
You want to give money or possessions to friends or charities</strong>.  When someone dies without a will, there are laws that dictate who will receive any assets.  These recipients will include immediate family members like parents, siblings, and a spouse.  If you want to give assets to friends or to a charity, you must protect your wishes with a will.</p>
<p><strong>You care about what happens to you if you are in a coma or persistent vegetative state</strong>.  We all see the stories on the news – ugly fights within families over the prostrate bodies of critically ill children or siblings or spouses.  When you write your will, write a health care directive (also called a living will) and a financial power of attorney as well.  This is especially important if you have a life partner to whom you are not married so they can make decisions on your behal</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve had an attorney draft your estate planning documents, including your living trust and will. Probate avoidance and tax saving strategies have been implemented. Your documents are signed, notarized and witnessed in accordance with all applicable laws, and are stored in a location known to your chosen executor or estate administrator. Your work is done, right? Not exactly.</p>
<p>Although treasure hunts may be fun for youngsters, the fiduciaries of your estate will not find inventorying your assets to be nearly as exciting. When it comes time to settle your affairs, your estate representatives will be charged with the responsibility to gather and manage your assets, pay off debts and taxes, and distribute your assets to your named beneficiaries. This can be a tall order for an outsider who is likely unaware of the full scope of your assets.</p>
<p>If your fiduciaries cannot determine exactly what property you own, and its value and location, you are setting up your loved ones for a frustrating treasure hunt that can delay the settlement of your estate and rack up additional estate-related expenses. You may be remembered for the frustration of locating your assets, rather than the gifts made upon your death – not a legacy many wish to leave.</p>
<p>Instead, as you are establishing your estate plan take the extra time to record a comprehensive asset inventory and make sure those who will be responsible for settling your estate know where that inventory is stored. Do not presume that everything is handled once you meet with a lawyer and sign your documents. The legal instruments you have gone to the time, trouble and expense to prepare are practically worthless if your assets cannot be identified, located and transferred to your beneficiaries. However, creating a thoughtful asset inventory will aid your loved ones in closing your estate and honoring your memory.</p>
<p>Nobody knows better what assets you own than you. And who better than you to know an item’s value, age or location? Your fiduciaries may not have the benefit of tax or registration renewal notices for titled assets, and certainly won’t have copies of the titles or deeds – unless you provide them. It’s a good idea to include copies of the following items with your asset inventory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deeds to real property</li>
<li>Titles to personal property</li>
<li>Statements for bank, brokerage, credit card and retirement accounts</li>
<li>Stock certificates</li>
<li>Life insurance policy</li>
<li>Tax notices</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of the above assets you should also list names and contact information for individuals who can assist with each the underlying assets, such as real estate attorneys, brokers, financial planners and accountants.</p>
<p>If your estate includes unique objects or valuable family heirlooms, a professional appraisal can help you plan your estate, and help your representatives settle your estate. If you have any property appraised, include a copy of the report with your asset inventory.</p>
<p>Care should be taken to continually update your asset inventory as things change. There will likely be many years between the time your estate plan is created and the day your fiduciaries must step in and settle your estate. Properties may be bought or sold, and these changes should be reflected in your asset inventory on an ongoing basis.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people erroneously assume that when one spouse dies, the other spouse receives all of the remaining assets; this is often not true and frequently results in unintentional disinheritance of the surviving spouse.</p>
<p>In cases where a couple shares a home but only one spouse’s name is on it, the home will not automatically pass to the surviving pass, if his or her name is not on the title. Take, for example, a case of a husband and wife where the husband purchased a home prior to his marriage, and consequently only his name is on the title (although both parties resided there, and shared expenses, during the marriage). Should the husband pass away before his wife, the home will not automatically pass to her by “right of survivorship”. Instead, it will become part of his probate estate. This means that there will need to be a court probate case opened and an executor appointed. If the husband had a will, the executor would be the person he nominated in his will who would carry out the testator’s instructions regarding disposition of the assets. If he did not have a will, state statutes, known as intestacy laws, would provide who has priority to inherit the assets.</p>
<p>In our example, if the husband had a will then the house would pass to whomever is to receive his assets pursuant to that will. That may very well be his wife, even if her name is not on the title.</p>
<p>If he dies without a will, state laws will determine who is entitled to the home. Many states have rules that would provide only a portion of the estate to the surviving spouse. If the deceased person has children, even if children of the current marriage, local laws might grant a portion of the estate to those children. If this is a second marriage, children from the prior marriage may be entitled to more of the estate. If this is indeed the case, the surviving spouse may be forced to leave the home, even if she had contributed to home expenses during the course of the marriage.</p>
<p>Laws of inheritance are complex, and without proper planning, surviving loved ones may be subjected to unintended expense, delays and legal hardships. If you share a residence with a significant other or spouse, you should consult with an attorney to determine the best course of action after taking into account your unique personal situation and goals. There may be simple ways to ensure your wishes are carried out and avoid having to probate your partner’s estate at death.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In creating a trust, the trustmaker must name a trustee who has the legal obligation to administer it in accordance with the trustmaker&rsquo;s wishes and intentions. In some cases, after the passing of the trustmaker, loved ones or beneficiaries may want to remove the designated trustee.</p>
<p>The process to remove a trustee largely depends on two factors: 1) language contained with the trust and 2) state law. When determining your options, there are a number of issues and key considerations to keep in mind.</p>
<p>First, it is possible that the trust language grants you the specific right to remove the named trustee. If it does, it likely will also outline how you must do so and whether you must provide a reason you want to remove them. Second, if the trust does not grant you the right to remove the trustee, it may grant another person the right to remove. Sometimes that other person may serve in the role of what is known as a &#8220;trust protector&#8221; or &#8220;trust advisor.&#8221; If that is in the trust document you should speak to that person and let them know why you want the trustee removed. They would need to decide if they should do so or not. Finally, if neither of those is an option, your state law may have provisions that permit you to remove a trustee. However, it may be that you will have to file a petition with a court and seek a court order. You should hire an attorney to research this for you and advise you of the likelihood of success.</p>
<p>Another option may be to simply ask the named trustee to resign. They may do so voluntarily.</p>
<p>Assuming the trustee is removed, whether by you, a trust protector, or by court order, or if the trustee resigns, the next issue is who is to serve as the successor trustee. Again, looking at the terms of the trust should answer that question. Perhaps a successor is specifically named or perhaps the trust provides the procedure to appoint the successor. Before proceeding, you will want to make certain you know who will step-in as the new trustee.</p>
