<p>On January 1, 2020, when the SECURE Act (“Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act”) went into effect, it vastly impacted how Americans save for retirement and access those funds.</p>



<p>This legislation included numerous changes; from Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) starting at 72 rather than 70½ to the removal of age limits on IRA contributions (Americans can now continue to contribute to their IRAs at any age while they are working).&nbsp; Now new parents can withdrawal $5,000 from an IRA or 401(k) after the birth or adoption of a child.&nbsp; Even some part-time employees are eligible to participate in 401(k) plans.&nbsp; The list of changes goes on and on.</p>



<p>However, a significant change in the estate planning world was the abolishment of stretch IRAs for most beneficiaries.&nbsp; The SECURE Act requires the entire balance of the participant&#8217;s account be distributed within ten years. There is an exception for surviving spouses, minor children, disabled and chronically ill beneficiaries, or a person not more than ten years younger than the IRA account owner. &nbsp;These individuals retain the ability to defer taxation over a longer period.&nbsp; However, many individuals are unable to defer taxation over a longer period.</p>



<p>Now is a good time to consider how your retirement strategy connects with estate and tax planning.&nbsp; If you have questions about how the SECURE Act impacts you, it makes sense to sit down with an experienced attorney, financial planner, and/or licensed tax professional to ensure that your plans consider the SECURE Act.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In order to predict how much your estate will have to pay in taxes, one must first determine the value of the estate. To determine this, many assets might have to be appraised at fair market value. The estate includes all assets including real estate, cash, securities, stocks, bonds, business interests, loans receivable, furnishings, jewelry, and other valuables.</p>
<p>Once your net worth is established, you can subtract liabilities like mortgages, credit cards, other legitimate debts, funeral expenses, medical bills, and the administrative cost to settle your estate including attorney, accounting and appraisal fees, storage and shipping fees, insurances, and court fees. The administrative expenses will likely total roughly 5% of the total estate. Any assets that is bequeathed to charity through a trust escapes taxation, and the value of those assets must be subtracted from the total. Any assets transferred to a surviving spouse are not subject to taxation as long as your spouse is a US citizen.</p>
<p>If the net worth of an estate is less than the Federal and state exemptions, no taxes must be paid. However, the value of assets over the exemptions will be taxed. The amount over the exemptions is referred to as the taxable estate. A testator’s assets are taxed by the state in which the will is probated. Taxes paid by the estate to the state may be deducted for Federal tax purposes. The Federal exemption was $5.43 million in 2015 and is slated to increase in 2016. The top Federal estate tax rate in 2015 was 40%.</p>
<p>If an estate earns money while it is being administered and distributed, for example, if real estate is rented or businesses continue to operate, it will be necessary for the estate to complete a tax return and pay taxes on the income it receives. The net income of the estate can be added to the taxable portion of the estate if it is over the federal or state exemption. It is important to be aware that the laws surrounding estate taxes change frequently and require seasoned professionals to navigate, and to notify you if changes in the laws will affect your estate plan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A tax basis is essentially the purchase price of a piece of property. Whenever that property is sold, the seller must pay taxes on the difference between the sale price and the original purchase price. This concept applies to all property, including stocks, bonds, vehicles, mechanical equipment, and real estate. If debts are assumed along with the purchase price, the principal amount of the debt will be included in the basis. The basis can be adjusted downwards when a person deducts depreciation costs on his or her income tax returns, and may be increased for capital investments towards improving the property that are not deducted for income tax purposes. Selling a property that has been held for a long time can carry a serious tax burden because of inflation, particularly when real estate prices have increased.</p>
<p>When an individual receives property as an inheritance, the tax basis is reset to whatever the fair market value is at the time of the transfer of title. This means that the heir would pay significantly less taxes if that property is sold by the beneficiary than if the original owner were to sell it and devise the money to his beneficiaries. Most simple wills provide that all of a testator’s assets are placed into a residual estate to be divided equally among the heirs. This means that an executor must liquidate the assets of the estate and divide the proceeds among the heirs. However, because there is no transfer of title before the property is sold, the heirs are stuck with the grantor’s basis and they lose an opportunity for a sizeable tax break.</p>
<p>A person planning his or her estate may also reset the basis in his or her property by giving it as a gift directly to his or her heirs or by gifting the property to an inter vivos trust. These actions can have their own tax related consequences, or create other unintended problems for the beneficiaries. Only an experienced estate planning attorney can advise you on the most efficient way to pass your assets on to your heirs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You spend your whole life building your legacy but sadly, that is not always enough. Without careful estate tax planning, much of it could be lost to taxes or misdirected. While a will or living trust is essential for dividing your estate as you wish, an estate tax plan ensures you pass on as much of your legacy as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding estate tax laws</strong></p>
<p>For the past decade, estate tax laws have been a sort of political football with significant changes occurring every few years. &nbsp;The good news is that the 2013 tax act made the basic $5 million estate tax exemption “permanent,” but at a higher rate of 40%, though the law continues to adjust the exemption level for inflation. With this adjustment the 2015 exclusion $5.43 million ($10.86 million per married couple). The law also retained exclusion “portability” which means that if one spouse dies in 2014 or 2015, the surviving spouse may pass on the unused portion of the deceased spouse’s exclusion. This portability is not automatic, however. The unused portion needs to be transferred by the executor to the surviving spouse, and a special tax return must be filed within nine months. The surviving spouse does not have to pay estate taxes at this time, they only become due after both spouses have died.</p>
<p><strong>Optimizing your estate plan</strong></p>
<p>One way to maximize the amount you can pass on is through annual gifting while you are alive. An individual is allowed to give $14,000 each year to another individual, tax-free. If you give more than that, it will reduce your basic lifetime exclusion. So, if you give a child $50,000 this year, your basic $5.43 million exclusion will be reduced by $36,000 at the time of your death. You can gift as much as your full $5.43 million exclusion before incurring taxes, although doing so would “exhaust” your estate tax exemption at death. Gift taxes are paid by the giver, not the recipient.</p>
<p>An experienced estate tax planning attorney can help minimize potential gift and estate taxes by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying taxable assets</li>
<li>Transforming your wishes into a will or living trust</li>
<li>Keeping you apprised of federal and state tax law changes</li>
<li>Establishing an annual gifting plan</li>
<li>Creating family and charitable trusts</li>
<li>Setting up IRA charitable rollovers</li>
<li>Setting up 529 education savings plans</li>
<li>Helping you create a succession plan for your family business</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s never pleasant to consider the end of your life, but planning for it will help ensure that the things you care about are cared for. It is one of the greatest gifts you can give your loved ones.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine if writing a last will and testament were a pre-requisite to graduating from high school.  The graduate walks across the stage, hands the completed will to the principal, and gets the diploma in return.   It might sound strange because most 18 year olds have little in terms of assets but it’s a good idea for all adults to draft a last will and testament.</p>
<p>Graduation from college is another good milestone to use as a reminder to create an estate plan.  If you haven’t created a will by the time you marry – or are living with a partner in a committed relationship – then it’s fair to say you are overdue.</p>
<p>Think you don’t need an estate plan because you’re broke?  Not true.  Here are eight excellent reasons for young people to complete a last will and testament.  And they have very little to do with money.<br />
<strong><br />
You are entering the military</strong>.  Anyone entering the military, at 18 or any other age, should make sure his or her affairs are in order.  Even for an 18-year-old, that means creating a will and other basic estate planning documents like a health care directive and powers of attorney.<br />
<strong><br />
You received an inheritance</strong>.  You may not think of the inheritance as your asset, especially if it is held in trust for you.  But, without an estate plan, the disposition of that money will be a slow and complicated process for your surviving family members.<br />
<strong><br />
You own an animal</strong>.  It is common for people to include plans for their pets in their wills.  If the unthinkable were to happen and you died unexpectedly, what would happen to your beloved pet?  Better to plan ahead for your animals in the event of your death.  You can even direct the sale of specific assets, with the proceeds going to your pet’s new guardian for upkeep expenses.</p>
<p><strong>You want to protect your family from red tape</strong>.  If you die without a will, your family will have to take your “estate” (whatever money and possessions you have at the time of your death) through a long court process known as probate. If you had life insurance, for example, your family would not be able to access those funds until the probate process was complete.  A couple of basic estate planning documents can keep your estate out of the probate court and get your assets into the hands of your chosen beneficiaries much more quickly.</p>
<p><strong>You have social media accounts</strong>.  Many people spend a great deal of time online, conversing with friends, storing important photos and documents and even managing finances. Without instructions from you, will your family know what to do with your Facebook account, your LinkedIn account, and so forth?<br />
<strong><br />
You want to give money or possessions to friends or charities</strong>.  When someone dies without a will, there are laws that dictate who will receive any assets.  These recipients will include immediate family members like parents, siblings, and a spouse.  If you want to give assets to friends or to a charity, you must protect your wishes with a will.</p>
<p><strong>You care about what happens to you if you are in a coma or persistent vegetative state</strong>.  We all see the stories on the news – ugly fights within families over the prostrate bodies of critically ill children or siblings or spouses.  When you write your will, write a health care directive (also called a living will) and a financial power of attorney as well.  This is especially important if you have a life partner to whom you are not married so they can make decisions on your behal</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve had an attorney draft your estate planning documents, including your living trust and will. Probate avoidance and tax saving strategies have been implemented. Your documents are signed, notarized and witnessed in accordance with all applicable laws, and are stored in a location known to your chosen executor or estate administrator. Your work is done, right? Not exactly.</p>
<p>Although treasure hunts may be fun for youngsters, the fiduciaries of your estate will not find inventorying your assets to be nearly as exciting. When it comes time to settle your affairs, your estate representatives will be charged with the responsibility to gather and manage your assets, pay off debts and taxes, and distribute your assets to your named beneficiaries. This can be a tall order for an outsider who is likely unaware of the full scope of your assets.</p>
<p>If your fiduciaries cannot determine exactly what property you own, and its value and location, you are setting up your loved ones for a frustrating treasure hunt that can delay the settlement of your estate and rack up additional estate-related expenses. You may be remembered for the frustration of locating your assets, rather than the gifts made upon your death – not a legacy many wish to leave.</p>
<p>Instead, as you are establishing your estate plan take the extra time to record a comprehensive asset inventory and make sure those who will be responsible for settling your estate know where that inventory is stored. Do not presume that everything is handled once you meet with a lawyer and sign your documents. The legal instruments you have gone to the time, trouble and expense to prepare are practically worthless if your assets cannot be identified, located and transferred to your beneficiaries. However, creating a thoughtful asset inventory will aid your loved ones in closing your estate and honoring your memory.</p>
<p>Nobody knows better what assets you own than you. And who better than you to know an item’s value, age or location? Your fiduciaries may not have the benefit of tax or registration renewal notices for titled assets, and certainly won’t have copies of the titles or deeds – unless you provide them. It’s a good idea to include copies of the following items with your asset inventory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deeds to real property</li>
<li>Titles to personal property</li>
<li>Statements for bank, brokerage, credit card and retirement accounts</li>
<li>Stock certificates</li>
<li>Life insurance policy</li>
<li>Tax notices</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of the above assets you should also list names and contact information for individuals who can assist with each the underlying assets, such as real estate attorneys, brokers, financial planners and accountants.</p>
<p>If your estate includes unique objects or valuable family heirlooms, a professional appraisal can help you plan your estate, and help your representatives settle your estate. If you have any property appraised, include a copy of the report with your asset inventory.</p>
<p>Care should be taken to continually update your asset inventory as things change. There will likely be many years between the time your estate plan is created and the day your fiduciaries must step in and settle your estate. Properties may be bought or sold, and these changes should be reflected in your asset inventory on an ongoing basis.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In creating a trust, the trustmaker must name a trustee who has the legal obligation to administer it in accordance with the trustmaker&rsquo;s wishes and intentions. In some cases, after the passing of the trustmaker, loved ones or beneficiaries may want to remove the designated trustee.</p>
<p>The process to remove a trustee largely depends on two factors: 1) language contained with the trust and 2) state law. When determining your options, there are a number of issues and key considerations to keep in mind.</p>
<p>First, it is possible that the trust language grants you the specific right to remove the named trustee. If it does, it likely will also outline how you must do so and whether you must provide a reason you want to remove them. Second, if the trust does not grant you the right to remove the trustee, it may grant another person the right to remove. Sometimes that other person may serve in the role of what is known as a &#8220;trust protector&#8221; or &#8220;trust advisor.&#8221; If that is in the trust document you should speak to that person and let them know why you want the trustee removed. They would need to decide if they should do so or not. Finally, if neither of those is an option, your state law may have provisions that permit you to remove a trustee. However, it may be that you will have to file a petition with a court and seek a court order. You should hire an attorney to research this for you and advise you of the likelihood of success.</p>
<p>Another option may be to simply ask the named trustee to resign. They may do so voluntarily.</p>
<p>Assuming the trustee is removed, whether by you, a trust protector, or by court order, or if the trustee resigns, the next issue is who is to serve as the successor trustee. Again, looking at the terms of the trust should answer that question. Perhaps a successor is specifically named or perhaps the trust provides the procedure to appoint the successor. Before proceeding, you will want to make certain you know who will step-in as the new trustee.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Year End Gifts</h2>
<p>If you’re like most people, you want to make sure you and your loved ones pay the least amount of tax possible. Many use year-end gift giving as a way to transfer wealth to younger generations and also reduce the overall potential estate tax that will be due upon their death. Below are some steps you can take to make gifts to your heirs without triggering any gift tax liability. Some of these techniques may also reduce your own income tax liability.</p>
<p>A combination of estate and gift tax exemptions can be used to significantly reduce the overall tax liability of your estate. Upon your death, federal estate tax may be owed. A portion of your estate is exempt from the tax. That exemption amount is set by Congress and can change from year to year. For deaths that occur in 2013, the federal exemption amount is $5.250 million and the value of an estate in excess of that amount is subject to estate tax. The Springfield exemption for an individual that died in 2013 is $1 million. The effective tax rate on amounts above a $1 million begins at 41% (for the the first hundred thousand above $1 million) and gradually moves to 10% (for an estate valued at $2 million). Springfield also has its own standalone gift tax that must be considered before making any gifts, especially those above the yearly federal exemption amount.</p>
<p>Many taxpayers make annual gifts to loved ones during their lifetimes, to reduce the overall value of the estate so that it does not exceed the exemption amount in effect at the time of death. It is important to consider that certain gifts made during your lifetime may be subject to a gift tax. However, certain gifts or transfers are not subject to the gift tax, enabling you to make tax-free gifts that benefit your loved ones and reduce the overall taxable value of your estate upon your death.</p>
<p>The annual gift tax exclusion allows each individual to make annual gifts of up to $14,000 to each recipient. There is no limit to the number of recipients who may each receive up to $14,000 totally tax-free. Married couples may gift up to $28,000 to each recipient without triggering any tax liability. This annual exclusion expires on December 31 of each year, and larger gifts may be made by splitting it up into two payments. By making a payment in December and one the following January, you can take advantage of the gift tax exclusion for both years. Keeping annual gifts below $14,000 per recipient ensures that no gift tax return must be filed, and that there is no reduction in the estate tax exemption amount available upon your death.</p>
<p>Annual gifts may also be made in the form of contributions to a §529 College Savings Plan. These, too, are subject to the $14,000 annual gift tax exclusion. Additionally, such contributions may afford the giver with a state tax deduction.</p>
<p>Payment of a beneficiary’s medical expenses is also excluded from the gift tax. There is no limit to the amount of medical expense payments that may be excluded from tax. To qualify, the payment must be made directly to the health care provider and must be the type of expenses that would qualify for an income tax deduction.</p>
<p>If you have a large estate that may be subject to taxes upon your death, making annual gifts during your lifetime can be a simple way to reduce the size of your estate while avoiding negative tax consequences. When making any gifts to reduce an estate, it is extremely important to take into consideration the potential income tax ramifications.</p>
<p>Before making yearly gifts to reduce your estate, it is recommended that you consult with a qualified estate planning attorney to ascertain the potential t</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Springfield Tax Law Changes Eliminate Gift Tax &#8211; More Details to Follow.  (3/24/2014)</p>
<p>On May 20, 2013, the Springfield Legislature passed the<strong> OMNibus Tax Bill</strong>, which made significant changes to Springfield estate and gift tax law.</p>
<p>One major change under the Bill is the imposition of a Springfield-specific Gift Tax that went into effect on July 1, 2013.  This new Gift Tax may have wide-ranging impact on Springfield taxpayers.  Springfield is only the second state in the country to have its own standalone gift tax.  The Bill establishes a 10% Gift Tax on all gifts above the federal yearly gift tax exemption currently set at $14,000.  The bill provides for a lifetime gift tax exemption of $1,000,000 per person.  This exemption essentially means that a Springfieldn would be able to make $1 million in gifts during his/her lifetime without being subject to paying a gift tax.  However, there would be a requirement to file a gift tax return (Form 709) for any gift(s) above the yearly exemption.</p>
<p>Another major change under the Bill is that all “taxable” gifts during the three years prior to a decedent’s passing are includable in their Springfield estate for the purposes of determining if an estate tax is owed to Springfield.  These changes will also impact end-of-life gifting, which was formerly an effective way of reducing a Springfield taxable estate.</p>
<p>You should consult with a qualified estate planning attorney to determine if and how the recent gift and estate tax law changes impact your own estate planning needs and goals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Discussions of the substantial estate taxes likely owed by James Gandolfini&#8217;s estate provide a glimpse into how even successful celebrities may not take full advantage of the estate tax planning strategies available to them.  Mr. Gandolfini&#8217;s Will apparently divided his estate amongst several family members, including his wife, children and other loved ones. By dividing his estate this way a significant estate tax, likely north of 40% of his total estate, will be due 9 months after his date of death.  The estate tax owed could have been completely avoided with certain estate planning strategies that many married couples take advantage of. With estate planning, a married couple can transfer an unlimited amount to their spouse upon their passing free from Federal and Springfield estate taxes.  Both federal and Springfield estate tax laws allow for an unlimited marital deduction, meaning no estate tax would be owed on the amounts transferred directly to a spouse upon the death of the first spouse.  Springfield&#8217;s standalone estate tax, which provides a one million dollar exemption to each spouse, often requires additional estate tax planning and administration to fully utilize the available exemptions.  Each person&#8217;s estate planning goals are unique and it is recommended that you consult with a qualified estate planning attorney to discuss your personal estate planning needs.</p>
