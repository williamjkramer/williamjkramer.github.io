										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In states that have “elective share statutes,” a surviving spouse is legally entitled to a certain percentage of the deceased&#8217;s estate, even if that spouse has attempted to disinherit or to provide a lesser bequest, or gift, under the will.  In “separate property” states, an elective share statute is likely to be in effect.  If the estate in question is valued at $50,000 or less, the elective share is likely to be the actual amount of the net estate.</p>
<p>“Testamentary substitutes” are removed from particular assets that would otherwise pass to the surviving spouse.  Assets passing by will or through intestacy could cause a reduction in the elective share amount as well.  Totten trusts, such as Payable-On-Death Bank Accounts (PODs), Retirement or joint bank accounts, gifts <em>causa mortis</em> (&#8220;gifts made by the decedent in contemplation of death,”) U.S. savings bonds, jointly held property, and gifts or transfers that were made approximately one year prior to death, are some examples of testamentary substitutes.</p>
<p>If a gift was made about one year prior to death, yet involves medical or educational expenses, then the gift may not qualify as a true testamentary substitute.  With regard to PODs, the spouse, offspring, or grandchildren will be named as beneficiaries.  The funds of a POD are only distributed upon the decedent’s death.   Testamentary Trusts are listed in the will until the designated property passes to the trust upon the testator’s death.</p>
<p>Generally, a gift <em>causa mortis</em> is only active upon the decedent’s expected death and is typically revocable.  Moreover, certain elements must exist to create a valid gift <em>causa mortis</em>.  These include an intent to create “an immediate transfer of ownership,” valid delivery, acceptance of the gift by the donee, and the donor’s “anticipation of imminent death.”  There are also certain circumstances by which gifts <em>causa mortis</em> are not valid.  For example, if the donee passes away before the donor, it is unlikely that a property interest was transferred.  Gifts <em>causa mortis </em>are also taxed as if the testator had listed the gifts in his or her will.</p>
<p>In such cases, testamentary substitutes are generally put back into the net estate total to determine the elective share amount that the surviving spouse will collect.  The aforementioned may vary if property is held jointly, as joint tenants or otherwise, because the spouse may have a right of survivorship in the property.  Estate planning attorneys are aware of all the ins and outs of testamentary substitutes and how they may affect the distribution of your assets.  It is useful, if not essential, to consult with a knowledgeable attorney when making arrangements regarding testamentary substitutes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, you have a will, but is it valid?&nbsp; A will can be contested for a multitude of reasons after it is presented to a probate court.&nbsp; It is in your best interest to have an attorney draft the will to prevent any ambiguity in the provisions of the document that others could dispute later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A will may be targeted on grounds of fraud, mental incapacity, validity, duress, or undue influence.&nbsp; These objections can draw out the probate process and make it very time consuming and expensive.&nbsp; More importantly, an attorney can help ensure that your property is put into the right hands, rather than distributed to unfamiliar people or organizations that you did not intend to provide for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time you executed the will, you must have been mentally competent, or of “sound mind.” &nbsp;A court will inquire as to whether you had full awareness of what you were doing.&nbsp; &nbsp;There will also be an inquiry into your understanding and knowledge of the assets in your name.&nbsp; If, at the moment you executed the will, you were pressured or influenced by another individual to sign the document, it may be invalidated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the document was signed under duress or undue influence, the provisions are likely to be against your intentions or requests.&nbsp; Moreover, if you are trying to nullify a will on your own behalf, you are likely to need an attorney because it is very difficult and complicated to demonstrate the existence of duress, fraud, or undue influence.&nbsp;&nbsp; If drafting a new will, counsel can ensure that your document abides by all of the validity requirements, so the will’s provisions can successfully carry out your intentions after your death.</p>
<p>For example, the will creator or “testator,” is usually required to sign the document before several witnesses who are over the age of eighteen, during a certain period of time. &nbsp;A will or a certain bequest to a person could be deemed void if the beneficiary was also a witness.&nbsp; &nbsp;In your state, you may be able to execute a “self-proving affidavit,” which may do away with some of the requirements in order to establish a valid will.&nbsp; The testator should also designate a person to execute the document.&nbsp; Consult your attorney to ensure that your will comports with your state’s particular laws and is sustainable against any future contests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An executor is the person designated in a Will as the individual who is responsible for performing a number of tasks necessary to wind down the decedent’s affairs. Generally, the executor’s responsibilities involve taking charge of the deceased person’s assets, notifying beneficiaries and creditors, paying the estate’s debts and distributing the property to the beneficiaries. The executor may also be a beneficiary of the Will, though he or she must treat all beneficiaries fairly and in accordance with the provisions of the Will.</span></p>
<p>First and foremost, an executor must obtain the original, signed Will as well as other important documents such as certified copies of the Death Certificate.  The executor must notify all persons who have an interest in the estate or who are named as beneficiaries in the Will. A list of all assets must be compiled, including value at the date of death. The executor must take steps to secure all assets, whether by taking possession of them, or by obtaining adequate insurance. Assets of the estate include all real and personal property owned by the decedent; overlooked assets sometimes include stocks, bonds, pension funds, bank accounts, safety deposit boxes, annuity payments, holiday pay, and work-related life insurance or survivor benefits.</p>
<p>The executor is responsible for compiling a list of the decedent’s debts, as well. Debts can include credit card accounts, loan payments, mortgages, home utilities, tax arrears, alimony and outstanding leases. All of the decedent’s creditors must also be notified and given an opportunity to make a claim against the estate.</p>
<p>Whether the Will must be probated depends on a variety of factors, including size of the estate and how the decedent’s assets were titled. An experienced probate or estate planning attorney can help determine whether probate is required, and assist with carrying out the executor’s duties. If the estate must go through probate, the executor must file with the court to probate the Will and be appointed as the estate’s legal representative.  Once the executor has this legal authority, he or she must pay all of the decedent’s outstanding debts, provided there are sufficient assets in the estate. After debts have been paid, the executor must distribute the remaining real and personal property to the beneficiaries, in accordance with the wishes set forth in the Will. Because the executor is accountable to the beneficiaries of the estate, it is extremely important to keep complete, accurate records of all expenditures, correspondence, asset distribution, and filings with the court and government agencies.</p>
<p>The executor is also responsible for filing all tax returns for the deceased person including federal and state income tax returns and estate tax filings, if applicable. Additional tasks may include notifying carriers for homeowner’s and auto insurance policies and initiating claims on life insurance policies.</p>
<p>The executor is entitled to compensation for his or her services.  This fee varies according to the estate’s size and may be subject to review depending on the complexity as well as the time and effort expended by the executor.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Creating a Will is not a one-time event. You should review your will periodically, to ensure it is up to date, and make necessary changes if your personal situation, or that of your executor or beneficiaries, has changed. There are a number of life-changing events that require your Will to be revised, including:</p>
<p><strong>Change in Marital Status:</strong> If you have gotten married or divorced, it is imperative that you review and modify your Will. With a new marriage, you must determine which assets you want to pass to your new spouse or step-children, and how that may relate to the beneficiary interest of your own children. Following a divorce it is a good idea to revise your Will, to formally remove the ex-spouse as a beneficiary, and also change your beneficiary on any life insurance policies, pensions, or retirement accounts.</p>
<p>Estate planning is complicated when there are children from multiple marriages, and an attorney can help you ensure everyone is protected, which may include establishing a trust in addition to the revised Will. Depending on jurisdiction, this may also apply to couples who have established or revoked a registered domestic partnership. If one of your Will’s beneficiaries experiences a change in marital status, that may also trigger a need to revise your Will.</p>
<p><strong>Births:</strong> Upon the birth of a new child, the parents should amend their Wills immediately, to include the names of the guardians who will care for the child if both parents die. Also, parents or grandparents may wish to modify the distribution of assets provided in their Wills, to include the new addition to the family.</p>
<p><strong>Deaths or Incapacity:</strong> If any of the named executors or beneficiaries of a Will, or the named guardians for your children, pass away or become incapacitated, your Will should be revised accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Change in Assets:</strong> Your Will may need to be changed if the value of your assets has significantly increased or decreased, or if you dispose of an asset. You may want to modify the distribution of other assets in your estate, to account for the changed value or disposition of the asset.</p>
<p><strong>Change in Employment:</strong> A change in the amount and/or source of income means your Will should be examined to see if any changes must be made to that document. Retirement or changing jobs could entail moving to another state, thus subjecting your estate to the laws of that state when you die. If the change in income modifies your investing, saving or spending habits, it may be time to review your Will and make sure the distribution to your beneficiaries will be as you intended.</p>
<p><strong>Changes in Probate or Tax Laws:</strong> Wills should be drafted to maximize tax benefits, and to ensure the decedent’s wishes are carried out. If the laws regarding taxation of the estate, distribution of assets, or provisions for minor children have changed, you should have your Will reviewed by an estate planning attorney to ensure your family is fully protected and your wishes will be fully carried out.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When someone dies without a will, it is known as dying <em>intestate</em>.  In such cases, state law (of the state in which the person resides) governs how the person&#8217;s estate is administered. In most states, the individual&#8217;s assets are split &#8212; with one third of the estate going to the spouse and all surviving children splitting the rest. For people who leave behind large estates, unless they have established trusts or other tax avoidance protections, there may be a tremendous tax liability, including both estate and inheritance tax.</p>
<p>For just about everyone, the cost of having a will prepared by a skilled and knowledgeable attorney is negligible when compared to the cost of dying <em>intestate</em>,  since there are a number of serious consequences involved in dying without a proper will in place.</p>
<h2><strong>Legal Consequences</strong></h2>
<p>The larger your estate, the more catastrophic the consequences of dying <em>intestate</em> will be. If you die without a will, the freedom to decide how your property will be divided will be taken from you and the state in which you reside will divide your assets.</p>
<p>Not only will you not be able to decide on the distribution of your property, but a stranger will be making personal, familial decisions. This may be divisive among your family members; instead of leaving your loved ones in peace, you may leave them engaged in bitter disputes over a family heirloom or even a simple memento. This can be especially true in situations where there are children from a previous marriage.</p>
<h2><strong>Tax Consequences</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to the legal and personal problems associated with dying <em>intestate</em>, the tax results can be severe as well. This is particularly true for clients who have not consulted with an estate planning attorney in order to protect themselves through tax avoidance methods. Both the state and federal governments can tax the transfer of property and an inheritance tax may be imposed on the property you have left to your heirs.</p>
<p>The most effective way to avoid all of these negative tax consequences is to create a will with a competent attorney. Your lawyer will help you to choose a proper executor (the person who will administer your estate, distribute your property and pay your debts), and will assist you in finding ways to limit your tax liability. There are several ways your attorney can help you to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>By gifting some of those you want to inherit before you die</li>
<li>By creating one or several trusts</li>
<li>By purchasing a life insurance policy</li>
<li>By buying investments in your loved one&#8217;s name</li>
</ul>
<p>These methods will ensure that your loved ones receive the assets you desire them to have, while simultaneously protecting them from possibly enormous tax burdens after you pass.</p>
<p>For those who have no family, dying without a will can be even more troublesome and costly, since their entire fortunes can be left to the state. If a genealogical search doesn&#8217;t turn up any blood relatives, all of your assets will be claimed by the government. This means that any individual, group, organization or charity you wished to endow will receive nothing.</p>
<p>It is never easy to think of one&#8217;s own mortality, but it is even more painful to contemplate leaving a messy, uncomfortable situation behind when you pass. By engaging the services of an excellent estate planning attorney, who will help you fashion a legally binding, precisely designed document,  you can make sure that your loved ones are well taken care of and that your final wishes are respected and implemented.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The role of an executor is to effectuate a deceased person’s wishes as declared in a will after he or she has passed on. <a href="https://bayareaelderlaw.com/san-jose-ca-estate-planning-lawyer_pa18765.htm">The executor’s responsibilities</a> include the distribution of assets according to the will, the maintenance of assets until the will is settled, and the paying of estate bills and debts. An old joke says that you should choose an enemy to perform the task because it is such a thankless job, even though the executor may take a percentage of the estate’s assets as a fee. The following issues should be considered when choosing an executor for one&#8217;s estate.</p>
<p><strong>Competency</strong>: The executor of an estate will be going through financial and legal documents and transferring documents from the testator to the beneficiaries. If there are legal proceedings, the executor must make all necessary court appearances. There is no requirement that a testator have any financial or legal training, but familiarity with these areas does avoid the intimidation felt by lay people, and potentially saves money on professional fees.</p>
<p><strong>Trustworthiness</strong>: The signature of an executor is equivalent to that of the testator of an estate. The executor has full control over all of an estate’s assets. He or she will be required to go through all of the papers of the deceased to confirm what assets are available to be distributed. The temptation to transfer assets into the executor&#8217;s own name always exists, particularly when there is a large estate. It is important to choose a person with integrity who will resist this temptation. It makes sense to utilize an individual who is an heir to fill the role to alleviate this concern.</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong>: The work of collecting rents, maintaining property, and paying debts can take more than a few hours a week. Selecting an executor with significant obligations to work or family may cause problems if he or she does not have the time available to devote to the task. If an executor must travel great distances to address issues that arise, there will be more of a time commitment necessary, not to mention greater expenses for the estate.</p>
<p><strong>Family dynamics</strong>: Selection of the wrong person to act as executor can create resentment and hostility among an estate’s heirs. A testator should be aware of how family members interact with one another and avoid picking someone who may provoke conflict. Even the perception of impropriety can lead to a lawsuit, which will serve to take money out of the estate’s coffers and delay the legitimate distribution of the estate.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This question presents a fairly common issue posed to estate planning attorneys. The solution is also pretty easy to address in your will, trust and other estate planning documents, including any guardianship appointment for your minor children.</p>
<p>First, its important to note that you should not delay establishing an estate plan pending the birth of a new child.&nbsp; In fact, if your planning is done right you most likely will not need to modify your estate plan after a new child is born.&nbsp; The problem with waiting is that you cannot know what tomorrow will bring and you could die, or become incapacitated and not having any type of plan is a bad idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of how an estate plan can provide for “after-born” children, there are a few drafting techniques that can address this issue.&nbsp; For example, in your will, it would refer to your current children typically by name and their date of birth. Then, your will would provide that any reference to the term &#8220;your children&#8221; would include any children born to you, or adopted by you, after the date you sign your will.</p>
<p>In addition, in the section or article of your will that provides how your estate and assets will be divided, it could simply provide that your estate and assets will be divided into separate and equal shares, one each for &#8220;your children.&#8221; That would mean that whatever children you have at the time of your death would receive a share and thus the will would work as you intend, even if you did not amend it after having a new child.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a side note, you should make certain that your plan does not give the children their share of your estate outright while they are still young.&nbsp; Rather, your will or living trust should provide that the assets and money are held in a trust structure until they are reach a certain age or achieve certain milestones such as college graduation or marriage. Any good estate planning attorney should be able to advise you about this and help walk you through the various options you have available to you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of writing a Last Will and Testament is to make sure that you – and not an anonymous probate court judge – have control over the distribution of your property after your death.&nbsp; If one or more family members disputes the instructions in your will, however, then it is possible&nbsp; that a probate court judge may decide how your assets will be distributed.</p>
<p>	Protect yourself, your family members and your last wishes by taking steps to prevent a will contest after your death.&nbsp; Will contests (this is the legal term used to describe a family member’s challenge to the contents of a will) can be based on one or more of these claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>
		The will was not properly executed</li>
<li>
		The willmaker was under improper or undue influence from a beneficiary</li>
<li>
		The willmaker or another person committed fraud</li>
<li>
		The willmaker lacked the mental capacity to make the will</li>
</ul>
<p>
	There are a number of steps that you can take to help prevent will contests based on any of those claims.&nbsp; It is important to remember, though, that different states have different laws regarding wills and probate.&nbsp; What is advisable in one state may be inadvisable in another, which is why the first suggestion for preventing a will contest is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
		<strong>Obtain qualified legal advice regarding your estate plan</strong>.&nbsp; Estate planning has become a popular “do it yourself” legal task, but you should at least consider having your will reviewed – if not written – by a qualified estate planning lawyer.&nbsp; Writing your will with the help of an estate planning attorney will also ensure that your will is a properly executed and valid legal document.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
<li>
		<strong>Don’t delay estate planning</strong>.&nbsp; Plan your estate while you are in good health – “of sound mind and body.”&nbsp; If you create your will while your physical or mental health is failing, your will becomes vulnerable to claims that it is invalid due to your lack of mental capacity.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
<li>
		<strong>Consider a no-contest clause</strong>.&nbsp; A no-contest clause (also called an in terroreum clause) in a Last Will and Testament disinherits anyone who contests the will.&nbsp; Keep in mind, though, that no-contest clauses are valid in some states but not in others.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
<li>
		<strong>Consider using trusts</strong>.&nbsp; Trusts are becoming more widely usedin estate planning , and are useful for various situations.&nbsp; A will is a public document once it is filed in probate court, and the public nature of the document can give rise to disputes and will contests.&nbsp; In contrast, a revocable living trust is a personal and private document that does not have to be filed as a public record.&nbsp; Furthermore, lifetime trusts can be used to provide financially for “troublesome” beneficiaries who might otherwise spend through their inheritance.&nbsp; Lifetime trusts are flexible and can link financial inheritance to the accomplishment of goals that you set forth in the trust documents.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
<li>
		<strong>Write your will independently</strong>.&nbsp; To avoid claims of undue influence after your death, make sure you write your will in circumstances that are clearly free from interference by family members or other beneficiaries.&nbsp; Avoid having beneficiaries serve as witnesses, for example, and don’t allow beneficiaries to attend your meetings with your estate planning attorney.&nbsp; This is especially important if you are under the care of a family member who is also a beneficiary.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
<li>
		<strong>Be of sound mind and body</strong>.&#038;n</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When relentless news coverage ensued following the death of Michael Jackson, it likely came as no surprise to his family, given his icon status and the unexpected timing and nature of his death. &nbsp;However, the media attention that surrounded the administration of his estate, making it a very public and dramatic affair, was neither expected nor welcomed by his loved ones.</p>
<p>Despite the well-known calamity that has arisen out of this estate administration process, Jackson did take one proper measure to organize his estate– he established a trust. When utilized in the right way, a trust ensures that matters are kept private and out of the probate court. However, Jackson failed to transfer his assets into that trust. Thus, what Jackson created was essentially a “pour-over” will that was intended to place his assets into a trust following his death. Unfortunately, a will is not an ideal vehicle for passing on assets, particularly significant assets amounting to $600 million dollars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, Jackson’s estate was forced to go through probate, where his estate and family endured an exhausting court process and torrent of public scrutiny. Ultimately, his estate was deprived of the crucial benefits of establishing the trust– privacy, decreased risk of family feuding, no waiting periods, asset protection, and avoidance of the probate court and estate taxes. In the end, Jackson’s ineffective estate planning cost an estimated $200 million in estate taxes, subjected family members to years of emotionally-draining litigation, and failed to accomplish estate planning objectives such as the disbursement of a trust fund for his children.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This high profile case serves as a startling reminder of the grueling consequences and costs that can result from poor estate planning. The financial burdens and emotional toll could have been prevented simply through the proper construction of an estate plan. A Revocable Living Trust, when utilized correctly, ensures privacy and efficiency in handling one’s affairs, as well as minimal hardships on loved ones.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A basic last will and testament cannot accomplish every goal of estate planning; in fact, it often cannot even accomplish the most common goals.  This fact often surprises people who are going through the estate planning process for the first time.  In addition to a last will and testament, there are other important planning tools which are necessary to ensure your estate planning wishes are honored.</p>
<p><strong>Beneficiary Designations<br />
</strong><em>Do you have a pension plan, 401(k), life insurance, a bank account with a pay-on-death directive, or investments in transfer-on-death (TOD) form?</em></p>
<p>When you established each of these accounts, you designated at least one beneficiary of the account in the event of your death.  You cannot use your will to change or override the beneficiary designations of such accounts.  Instead, you must change them directly with the bank or company that holds the account.</p>
<p><strong>Special Needs Trusts<br />
</strong><em>Do you have a child or other beneficiary with special needs?</em></p>
<p>Leaving money directly to a beneficiary who has long-term special medical needs may threaten his or her ability to qualify for government benefits and may also create an unnecessary tax burden.  A simple vehicle called a special needs trust is a more effective way to care for an adult child with special needs after your death.</p>
<p><strong>Conditional Giving with Living or Testamentary Trusts<br />
</strong><em>Do you want to place conditions on some of your bequests?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want your children or other beneficiaries to receive an inheritance only if they meet or continually meet certain prerequisites, you must utilize a trust, either one established during your lifetime (living trust) or one created through instructions provided in a will (testamentary trust).</p>
<p><strong>Estate Tax Planning<br />
</strong><em>Do you expect your estate to owe estate taxes?</em></p>
<p>A basic will cannot help you lower the estate tax burden on your assets after death.  If you think your estate will be liable to pay taxes, you can take steps during your lifetime to minimize that burden on your beneficiaries.  Certain trusts operate to minimize estate taxes, and you may choose to make some gifts during your lifetime for tax-related reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship<br />
</strong><em>Do you own a house with someone “in joint tenancy”?</em></p>
<p>“Joint tenancy” is the most common form of house ownership with a spouse.  This form of ownership is also known as “joint tenancy with right of survivorship,” “tenancy in the entirety,” or “community property with right of survivorship.”  When you die, your ownership share in the house passes directly to your spouse (or the other co-owner).  A provision in your will bequeathing your ownership share to a third party will not have any effect.</p>
<p><strong>Pet Trusts<br />
</strong><em>Do you want to leave money to your pets or companion animals?</em></p>
<p>Pets are generally considered property, and you cannot use your will to leave property (money) to other property (pets).  Instead, you can use your will to name a caretaker for your animals and to leave a sum of money to that person for the animals’ care.</p>
